ADV data:
------------------------------------
Scripts provided for a) Conversion and combination of Nortek's ASCII output files into combined netcdf's in burst-block structure, b) quality controlling the timeseries of velocity, c) conversion of 16 Hz timeseries into 15-minute block flow and wave statistics.

------------------------------------
ACVP data:
------------------------------------
Scripts for debinarizing data from the Ubertone UBFlow-3C is proprietary by Ubertone, and could not be distributed in an open-access repository. Contact Ubertone for user rights and the authors for the version used in this study. 
Scripts for analysis of the debinarized ACVP data are included in the analysis folder.

------------------------------------
SRPS data:
------------------------------------
Scripts procided for a) reading the SRPS binarized data and reconstructing the bed footprints, b) processing these footprints into timeseries of ripple characteristics.
Starting point for this code was the repository for SONAR3D analysis from the UtrechtCoastalGroup: https://github.com/UtrechtCoastalGroup/Sonar3D/tree/4063fc0c5e828a337436132bd32decbfdee7c1e2. They developed this (Matlab) code developed within the EU-funded Hydralab IV Bardex II project. Results of the subsequent analyses can be found in Ruessink et al. (2015), https://doi.org/10.3390/jmse3041568. 
Later on, their group was commissioned by Rijkswaterstaat to extend and apply the code to data collected as part of the Kustgenese 2 project. As part of this work, the resulting code  was made OpenSource.

Analysis:

 Scripts provided to generate the figures in the manuscript "Observations of intermittent cross-shore bed load transport on a low-energy beach" by Van der Lugt et al. (2025) under consideration for JGR Oceans.
